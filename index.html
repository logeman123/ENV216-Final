							<p>This location is a bird sanctuary within the city limits of Minneapolis, suprisingly it's actually fairly isolated from huge buildings and loud noise- which makes it a great place for birdwatching. The mix between pine and oak trees make it an interesting spot for a variety of bird species. However, the cold Minnesota climate means that much of the food sources for many birds is much more difficult to find. Still there were some interesting finds here!

								<p>The Red-tailed Hawk is just on the cusp of a full time resident within Minneapolis, but remains year-round<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"> within southern Minnesota. They often search for nests within high perching structures, which provides them the ability to use their <i>buteo</i> wings effectively. A predator of small prey, the Red-tailed Hawk is an effective hunter in both Summer and Winter. <br> <br>Specific to Minneapolis, the Red-tailed Hawk thrives here because of the wooded deciduous forests. It makes prey in the Winter easy to spot against the backdrop of the snow, with little place to hide in the brush. <br><br>Preston, C. R. and R. D. Beane (2020).

								<p>The American Tree Sparrow is a common winter bird species in Minnesota, typically appearing in the state from<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">  October to April. They are typically found in open areas such as fields, prairies, and shrubby areas, and they feed on seeds, berries, and insects. They are often seen in flocks, foraging on the ground.
									During the breeding season, they typically nest in the boreal forest and tundra regions of Canada, but in winter they migrate south to the northern and central regions of the United States, including Minnesota. <br> <br>
									The population has been in decline in Minnesota, as well as other states in the northern Great Plains, due to habitat loss and other factors. Conservation efforts such as habitat restoration and protection, as well as monitoring of population trends, are being undertaken to help stabilize and hopefully increase the population of this species in Minnesota.
									<br><br>
									Their natural habitat includes open tundra, shrubby areas, and fields in the boreal forest and tundra regions of Canada, where they breed during the summer. They prefer to nest in low shrubs and in the ground.
									
									As a migratory bird, they lack the proper food source during the harsh winters and thus move further south into places like Minnesota.

								<p>The Mallard is a common duck species in Minnesota, found throughout the state in <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">  a variety of habitats including wetlands, marshes, ponds, lakes, and rivers. They are known for their distinctive green head and yellow bill, and they have a brown body with a white ring around the neck.
									<br><br>
									During the breeding season, mallards in Minneapolis typically nest near freshwater wetlands, such as marshes, ponds, and lakes. They build their nests on the ground, often near water and in tall vegetation for cover. They lay an average of 8-12 eggs per clutch.
									<br><br>
									In the winter, mallards can be found in a variety of habitats including wetlands, agricultural fields, and suburban areas. They feed on a variety of plant materials, including seeds, roots, and aquatic plants, as well as insects and crustaceans. Which the Minnesota winter supports in many places, mainly rivers.
									Mallards are considered a game species in Minnesota, and hunting is regulated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. They also have a very high population and are not considered threatened or endangered. However, habitat loss and degradation are still a threat to their population.

									<h2><a href="#">Barn Swallow<br />

								</header>
								<a href="https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/478778401" class="image fit"><img src="images/bs.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Barn Swallow is a migratory bird species that is commonly found in Minnesota during<span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4">   the breeding season, which typically runs from late April to early September. They are known for their distinctive long, forked tail, and their rust-colored throat and upper breast. <br><br>
									During the breeding season, Barn Swallows in Minnesota typically nest in man-made structures such as barns, sheds, and bridges. They build cup-shaped nests made of mud, grass, and feathers, which they attach to walls and rafters. They lay an average of 4-6 eggs per clutch.
									Because of this the city enviroment of Minneapolis combined with the wetness gives the Barn Swallow a viable place to stay during the breeding season. <br><br>
									Barn Swallows are aerial foragers, feeding on flying insects such as flies, beetles, and mosquitoes. They can often be seen flying low over fields, marshes, and other open areas, catching insects in flight. <br><br>
									In the winter, they migrate to Central and South America. Their population has been declining in Minnesota, as well as other parts of North America, due to habitat loss and degradation. Conservation efforts such as habitat restoration, monitoring of population trends and protection of their nesting sites are being undertaken to help stabilize and hopefully increase the population of this species.

							<b>Wood Duck</b>
							<i>Aix Sponsa</i>
							<br><br>
							<p>The Wood Duck is a common resident within Minneapolis, which takes advantage over the many lakes avaliable. It would be considered a generalist among water birds.</p>

							<b>Wild Turkey</b>
							<i>Meleagris gallopavo</i>
							<br><br>
							<p>Turkey are among the largest of the birds in North America, so much so that they're often mistaken for other animals. They thrive in Minneapolis specifically because of the urban enviroment and habitat among woods, however since so much of the United States is wooded it can be considered a generalist.</p>

							<b>Mourning Dove</b>
							<i>Zenaida Macroura</i>
