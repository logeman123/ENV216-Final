				<p>Fargo is signifigantly different in climate than Minneapolis, while only being about 4 hours away- there is less lakes and it's much colder. In fact it's considered one of the coldest places in the entire continental US. However, birds still find an interesting way to keep their home throughout the winter, and its home to a wide variety of species.
				This specific location was a somewhat forested area, that was wrapped by a large river. Because of this the density of waterbirds seemed higher, although there was certainly common birds elsewhere.

					<p>The Ring-necked Pheasant is a non-native pheasant species that is commonly found in the Fargo, North Dakota area and in the<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">  surrounding regions of the state. They are known for their bright plumage, with males having a distinctive iridescent green head, red face, and white ring around the neck. They are a large bird, typically measuring around 32-35 inches in length.
							<br><br>
						Ring-necked Pheasants are found in a variety of habitats in the Fargo area, including grasslands, croplands, and wetlands. They are known to feed on a variety of plant materials, including seeds, roots, and berries, as well as insects and other small invertebrates.
							In the breeding season, males establish territories and court females by displaying their colorful plumage and making loud calls. Females typically lay an average of 8-15 eggs per clutch, which are incubated for about 24 days.
							<br><br>
							Often the Ring-necked Pheasant will instead of migrating long distances, will migrate to different habitats within a general area. This makes them somewhat of winter residents and the Fargo, ND area gives them a lot of lush land to thrive on.

					<p>The American crow is a highly adaptable bird and can be found in a variety of<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">  habitats throughout the Midwest region of the United States. They are commonly found in urban and suburban areas, as well as in woodlands, grasslands, and agricultural areas. They are fairly opportunistic birds and are able to thrive in a wide range of environments.
							Inside the cities, such as Fargo, crows can often be found in parks, backyards, and along roadsides. They scavenge for food in these areas, including garbage and roadkill. They are also known to congregate around landfills, grocery stores, and other places where food is readily available.
							<br><br>
							In woodlands and grasslands, crows can be found in both deciduous and coniferous forests. They are known to forage for food among the trees and on the ground, eating a variety of fruits, seeds, and insects. They also use these areas for nesting and roosting. This makes large open spaces, with the climate that exists within Fargo easily adaptable to such a crow.
							<br><br>
							In the agricultural areas that surround much of Fargo, crows can be found foraging among crops, such as corn and soybeans. They are known to feed on the insects that are attracted to these crops, as well as on the seeds and fruits of the plants themselves.
							In general, the American crow is a highly adaptable bird that can be found in a variety of habitats throughout the Midwest region. They are able to thrive in urban, suburban, and rural areas, and can be found in both natural and human-altered landscapes.

					<p>Indigo Bunting is a songbird that resides it's summers within Fargo and the surrounding area. The Indigo Bunting is an interesting <span

							 species of bird because it summers in the upper Midwest all the way down to some of the Southern States. It's included on this list because it's something that thrives in the open wooded fields that are common in Fargo.
							<br><br>
							As one of the only song birds on this list, they gather in flocks in the fields where agriculture is prevelant.

					<p>The Northern Saw-whet Owl is a nocturnal bird and is most active at night, it can<span
							id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4">  be found in a variety of habitats, including coniferous forests, mixed woodlands, and riparian areas. They are known to nest in tree cavities or nest boxes, and will also use abandoned woodpecker holes. They feed mainly on small mammals such as mice, voles and shrews and will also take small birds, insects, and invertebrates.
								<br><br>
								
								The Northern Saw-whet Owl is generally a hard bird to spot and not often seen, they are generally quite secretive, and their small size and nocturnal habits make them even more difficult to spot. They are known to have a distinctive vocalization, which can often be heard during the breeding season.
								<br><br>
								It benefits from the Fargo area landscape because they blend in effectively during the winter season, which is part of the reason why they are somewhat more prevalent in this area during that time.
